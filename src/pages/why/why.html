            </ion-card-title>
            <p>
                Adam Whitmire grew up around real estate, watching his family build one of the largest investmentportfolios 
                in NorthGeorgia. As the portfolio grew from single family houses to apartment buildings, storage units and industrial 
                parks, Adam had a chance to learn a great deal about investing. Often this included first- hand experience rolling up 
                his sleeves and assisting with renovation projects. Later as he developed his skill-set, Mr. Whitmire was able to design 
                commercial buildings and do layouts for subdivisions. After getting a real estate license in his early twenties, Adam was 
                the lead agent on a large new construction subdivision, and later went on to sell apartment buildings. He has owned various 
                investment properties, using both creative financing and traditional techniques for acquisitions. Recently his love of real 
                estate has led him to purchase and renovate foreclosures. For the last six years Mr. Whitmire has also been a partner in a 
                financial services firm with offices in Gainesville and Alpharetta. He has his insurance, Series 6, Series 63 and Variable 
                licenses and is currently working on his Series 65. In his spare time Adam is a nationally ranked submission fighter, he also 
                enjoys reading, graphic design, painting. Adam is married and has three children.
