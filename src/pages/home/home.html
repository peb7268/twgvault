            the property vault
        </ion-card-title>
        <p>
            Unlike MLS databases, our vault is screened regularly to eliminate properties not available
            or not desirable to our clients. Our scouts visit pre-determined high cash-flow markets to find 
            the very best properties available. These homes are then videoed and rehab estimates are determined 
            by a local contractor. All our information on these properties, including potential returns and 
            strategy, are uploaded to our website for our clients all over the world to see, so that informed and 
            educated decisions can be made.

            buy off-market properties
        </ion-card-title>
        <p>
          Why wait for your property to cash-flow when you can buy turnkey. 
          Do not bother with the banks. Why negotiate with 5-6 properties in hopes 
          that one will go through. Select from our list of turnkey homes. These homes 
          have already been negotiated and purchased from the bank. Rehab has already been 
          completed, and tenants are in place. This results in an immediate cash-flow position 
          and saves you 30-60 days.

            research other markets
        </ion-card-title>
        <p>
          Everyone knows that real estate is "Location, Location, Location!" Find out what makes one 
          location different that another. How much does one dollar of rent cost in my area compared to 
          another area. Are rents increasing or decreasing in my area. Market research can give insight 
          into a property's past, present, and future. Knowing this information can potentially reduce 
          your chance of a bad buy and help you sleep better at night.
